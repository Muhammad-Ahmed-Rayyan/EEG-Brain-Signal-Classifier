## üìñ Overview

This project focuses on **classifying EEG brain signals** into **actions and commands** like *left, right, help, stop, danger, etc.* using **feature extraction** from both **time domain** and **frequency domain**.

Two ML models are implemented:

- **KNN Classifier** (with cross-validation to select best `k`)
- **Random Forest Classifier** (with cross-validation to select best `n_estimators`)

The EEG samples are stored as **JSON files**, each representing a temporal sequence of signals across multiple channels.

---


## üßæ Dataset Format

- EEG signals are stored in **JSON files**.
- Each JSON has **keys as timestamps (`0ms`, `10ms`, ...)**.
- Each timestamp contains an array shaped `(8, 16)` ‚Üí **8 channels √ó 16 values**.
- A single trial is stacked into `(16, 8, 16)`.

**Example JSON snippet:**
```bash
{
  "0ms": [[...8x16 values...]],
  "10ms": [[...8x16 values...]],
  ...
}
```

## üß™ Features Extracted

From each channel:

- Time Domain: mean, std, max, min
- Frequency Domain: mean(FFT), std(FFT)

Total: 6 features √ó 8 channels = 48 features per trial.
